T-Rex Game on LCD
This is a small project I made using an Arduino and an LCD screen. It’s based on the T-Rex game you see in Chrome when there’s no internet. The goal is to jump over obstacles and avoid crashing.

How It Works:
The T-Rex starts on the ground.
Press the button to make it jump over a cactus.
A power-up (*) randomly appears, and if you collect it you become invincible for a few seconds.
If you crash into a cactus it’s game over. The game will show your score, and you can restart by pressing the button.

Main Features:
Jump over obstacles by pressing the button.
Power-ups appear randomly and make you invincible for a short time.
Keeps track of your score and high score.
The game gets harder as you play because it speeds up.
How to Play
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Connect the components as described above.
Press the button to start the game.
Jump over obstacles to keep going.
